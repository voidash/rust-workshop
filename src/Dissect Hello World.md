`fn main() {     println!("Hello, World!"); }`

1. **`fn main() { ... }`:** This is the entry point of the Rust program. In Rust, every program must have a `main` function. When you run your program, the code inside `main` is executed first.

1. **`println!("Hello, World!");`:** This is the main part of the program that prints the "Hello, World!" message to the console. Here's what's happening here:
   
   * `println!`: This is a Rust macro for printing text to the console. Macros in Rust are like functions but with an exclamation mark (`!`) at the end.
   
   * `"Hello, World!"`: This is the message that the `println!` macro will print. It's enclosed in double quotes to indicate that it's a string of characters.
   
   * `;` (semicolon): This is the statement terminator in Rust, indicating the end of this line of code. Rust uses semicolons to separate statements.

So, when you run the program, the `main` function is called, and it, in turn, calls `println!("Hello, World!");`, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
